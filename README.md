Welcome to my Airline Price Prediction Project! In this repository, I've developed a machine learning model aimed at forecasting airline ticket prices. By analyzing historical data, including departure/arrival locations, booking times, airline preferences, and seasonal trends.the model strives to provide accurate predictions. Contributors are welcome to explore different models, tweak parameters, and share insights to enhance the predictive capabilities of this system.
